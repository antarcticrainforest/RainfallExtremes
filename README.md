## Simulation Convective Extreme Events
This projects investigates how well convective extreme events are captured in high resolution models ( &#8776; 1.5km to &#8776; 150m).
For this purpose the eight consecutive days of strong island thunderstorms events in the Monsoon break period over the [Tiwi-Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_Islands "Wikipedia") in Northern Australia.
For a fact the  local convective systems forming in the afternoon over the islands are the worlds most consistently occurring extreme events in the world [Crook, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493%282001%29129%3C1550%3AUHTDOI%3E2.0.CO%3B2, "Understanding Hector"). Named by pilots during the Second World War, the recurring position of the thunderstorm made it a navigational beacon for pilots and mariners in the region. Hector is known to be initialised by local forcing, that is colliding sea-breeze fronts fronts over the islands. 

Since the late 1980s the thunderstorm has been the subject of many meteorological studies, and this study is no exception. Yet, here we take the recurrence of the island thunderstorm as a proxy for locally forced convective extreme events in general and study the ability of the UK Met Office's unified model (UM) a limited area numerical weather forecasting system at different resolutions to represent extreme events. 

The following collection of [jupyter-slides](http://www.slideviper.oquanta.info/tutorial/slideshow_tutorial_slides.html#/4 "Jupyter Slides Tutorial") shows the results of the above mentioned model study:
